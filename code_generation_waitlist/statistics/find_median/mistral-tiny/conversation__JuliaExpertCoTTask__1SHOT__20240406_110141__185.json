Think through the approach step by step:\n   First, we need to sort the array to find the median. The median is the middle value when the array is sorted. If the array has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle value. If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n   We don't need any additional functions for this task.\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction find_median(arr)\n    sorted_arr = sort(arr)\n    length_arr = length(arr)\n\n    if length_arr % 2 == 0\n        median = (sorted_arr[div(length_arr, 2)] + sorted_arr[div(length_arr, 2) + 1]) / 2\n    else\n        median = sorted_arr[div(length_arr, 2) + 1]\n    end\n\n    return median\nend\n```\n\n4.
