It first checks if the array's length is odd or even. If it's odd, it returns the middle element. If it's even, it returns the average of the two middle elements. The example usage shows an array with seven elements and the resulting median value.","status":200,"tokens":[78,231],"elapsed":2.060427541,"cost":0.001542,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2113978386,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
