[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `find`. It computes median over arbitrary array. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nfind_median(arr)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Approach\n1. Define a function `find` that takes an array `arr` as input.\n2. Sort the array `arr` in ascending order.\n3. Calculate the length of the sorted array.\n4. Check if the length of the sorted array is odd or even.\n5. If the length is odd, return the middle element as the median.\n6. If the length is even, return the average of the two middle elements as the median.\n\nI will now write the code based on this approach.","status":200,"tokens":[133,105],"elapsed":1.951729209,"cost":0.00022400000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1923138657,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
