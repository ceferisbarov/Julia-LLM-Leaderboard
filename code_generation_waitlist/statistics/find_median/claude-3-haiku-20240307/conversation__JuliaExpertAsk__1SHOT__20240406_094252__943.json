If the length is even, it takes the average of the two middle elements; if the length is odd, it returns the middle element.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates calling the `find` function with the array `[5, 2, 9, 1, 7, 3, 8]`, and the function returns the median value of `5.0`.","status":200,"tokens":[71,347],"elapsed":3.478174416,"cost":0.0004515000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-31725,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
