[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `find`. It computes median over arbitrary array.

If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\narr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 7]\nmedian = find(arr)\nprintln(median) # Output: 5.0\n```\n\nIn this example, the input array `[5, 2, 9, 1, 7]` has a length of 5, which is odd. The sorted array is `[1, 2, 5, 7, 9]`, and the middle element is 5, which is the median.\n\nThe function handles arrays of any length and type that can be sorted (as long as the type is a subtype of `AbstractVector`).","status":200,"tokens":[322,339],"elapsed":4.202556458,"cost":0.00050425,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-14844,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
