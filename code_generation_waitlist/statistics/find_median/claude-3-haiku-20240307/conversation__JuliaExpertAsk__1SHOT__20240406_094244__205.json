If the length is even, it takes the average of the two middle elements; if the length is odd, it returns the middle element.","status":200,"tokens":[71,230],"elapsed":2.468734334,"cost":0.0003052500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":29085,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
