Sort the input array in ascending order.\n2. Determine the length of the sorted array.\n3. Calculate the median based on whether the length of the array is even or odd.\n\nFor an even-length array, the median is the average of the two middle elements. For an odd-length array, the median is the middle element.","status":200,"tokens":[139,383],"elapsed":3.608018,"cost":0.0005135000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-2299,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
