It first sorts the array in ascending order using the `sort` function. Then, it checks if the length of the array is odd or even. If it's odd, the median is the middle element of the sorted array. If it's even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\nThe example provided demonstrates the usage of the `find_median` function with an example array `[5, 2, 9, 1, 7]`, and the output is `5.0`, which is the median of the array.","status":200,"tokens":[139,417],"elapsed":3.689062041,"cost":0.000556,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":10176,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
