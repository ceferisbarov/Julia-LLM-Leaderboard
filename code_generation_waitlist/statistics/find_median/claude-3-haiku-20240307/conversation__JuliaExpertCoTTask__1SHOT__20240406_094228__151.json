Sort the array in ascending order.\n2. Determine the length of the array.\n3. Compute the median based on the length of the array:\n   - If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n   - If the length is odd, the median is the middle element.\n\nThis solution ensures that the median is calculated correctly for arrays of any length and composition.","status":200,"tokens":[139,390],"elapsed":3.407661583,"cost":0.00052225,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":17719,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
