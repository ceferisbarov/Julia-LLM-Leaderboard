Here's an example of how to use it:\n\nFirst, you need to install the package if you haven't already. You can do this by running the following command in your Julia REPL:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Medians\")\n```\n\nThen, you can define the `find` function as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Medians\n\nfunction find(arr)\n    return median(arr)\nend\n```\n\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\narr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n\nmedian_value = find(arr)\nprintln(\"The median value is: \", median_value)\n```\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```\nThe median value is: 5.5\n```\n\nNote that the `median` function in `Medians.jl` handles missing values and multi-dimensional arrays. If you're working with a one-dimensional array without missing values, you can also use the built-in `median` function in Julia, which is faster for this specific use case.","status":200,"tokens":[73,314],"elapsed":3.413437375,"cost":0.00203,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":278739933,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
