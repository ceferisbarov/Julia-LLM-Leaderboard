Then it checks if the length of the array is odd or even. If it's odd, it returns the middle element. If it's even, it returns the average of the middle two elements.\n\nThe function is then tested with two arrays, one with an odd number of elements and one with an even number of elements.","status":200,"tokens":[149,359],"elapsed":3.992892459,"cost":0.002452,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":637723701,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
