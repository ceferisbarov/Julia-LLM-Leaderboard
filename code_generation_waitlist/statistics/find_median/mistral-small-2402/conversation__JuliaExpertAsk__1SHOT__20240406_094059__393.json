Here's how you can use it:\n\nFirst, make sure you have the package installed. If not, install it using the package manager:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Medians\")\n```\n\nThen, you can write the `find` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Medians\n\nfunction find(arr)\n    return median(arr)\nend\n```\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nmedian_val = find(arr)\nprintln(\"Median of the array is: \", median_val)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nMedian of the array is: 5.0\n```","status":200,"tokens":[73,221],"elapsed":2.464718625,"cost":0.0014720000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1731146122,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
