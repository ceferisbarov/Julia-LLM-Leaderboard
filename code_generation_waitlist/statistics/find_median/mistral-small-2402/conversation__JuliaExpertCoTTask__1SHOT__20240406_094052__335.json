If it has an even number of elements, it returns the average of the middle two elements. If it has an odd number of elements, it returns the middle element.","status":200,"tokens":[149,370],"elapsed":4.014265667,"cost":0.0025180000000000003,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":411929307,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
