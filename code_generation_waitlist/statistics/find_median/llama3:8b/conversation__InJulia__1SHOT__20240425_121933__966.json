The function first sorts the array in ascending order, then checks if the length of the array is even or odd. If it's even, the median is the average of the two middle elements; if it's odd, the median is the middle element.\n\nIn the example usage section, we create an array `arr` with some values and call the `find` function on it to compute its median, which is then printed to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[0,226],"elapsed":10.789213115,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-18653,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
