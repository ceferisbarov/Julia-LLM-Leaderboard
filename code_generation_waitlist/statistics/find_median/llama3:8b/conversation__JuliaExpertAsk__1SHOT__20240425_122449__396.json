Then it checks if the length of the array is even or odd. If it's even, the median will be the average of the two middle numbers. If the length is odd, the median will be the number in the middle.","status":200,"tokens":[0,174],"elapsed":8.218790074,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-30496,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
