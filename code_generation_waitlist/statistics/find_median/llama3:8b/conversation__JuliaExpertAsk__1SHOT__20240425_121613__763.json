Then, if the length of the array is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If the length is odd, the median is the middle number.","status":200,"tokens":[0,169],"elapsed":7.953941872,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-11083,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
