If the length is even, we find the two middle elements and take their average to get the median. If the length is odd, we simply return the middle element.","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":9.544884855,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":30940,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
