Then we check if the length of the array is even or odd. If it's even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. If it's odd, the median is the middle element.\n\nThe example usage shows how to compute and print the median of an array `[3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]`. The output will be `Median: 11.0`, since 11 is the middle value in this sorted array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":11.260209205,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":29863,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
