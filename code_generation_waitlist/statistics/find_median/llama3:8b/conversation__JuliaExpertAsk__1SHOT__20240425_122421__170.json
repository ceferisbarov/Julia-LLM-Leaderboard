If it's even, we return the average of the two middle elements. If it's odd, we find the position of the maximum element and return that as the median.\n\nThe `findpos` function finds the position of a given number in the array by iterating through the array until it finds the number.","status":200,"tokens":[0,248],"elapsed":11.865334507,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-9042,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
