Then, the length of the array (`n`) is calculated and checked if it's even or odd. If it's even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. If it's odd, the median is the middle element itself.","status":200,"tokens":[0,199],"elapsed":9.42421645,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-18879,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
