If the length of the array is even, it calculates the average of the two middle elements as the median. Otherwise, it returns the middle element (since there's only one in this case).","status":200,"tokens":[0,168],"elapsed":7.955572663,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-18660,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
