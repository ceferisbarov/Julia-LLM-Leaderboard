Then it checks if the length of the array is even or odd. If it's even, the median is the average of the two middle elements (`arr[n//2]` and `arr[n//2 + 1]`). If it's odd, the median is the single middle element (`arr[div(n, 2) + 1]`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":11.380777085,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":3398,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
