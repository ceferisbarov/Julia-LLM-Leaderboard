The function first sorts the array in ascending order using the `sort` function. Then it checks if the length of the array is even or odd. If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. If the length is odd, the median is the middle element.","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":9.88448727,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":4179,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
