Then, we check if the length of the array is even or odd. If it's even, we return the average of the two middle elements. If it's odd, we return the middle element.\n\nThe example usage shows how to find the median of an array of numbers. The output will be: `The median of the array is 8`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":9.879827706,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":17931,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
