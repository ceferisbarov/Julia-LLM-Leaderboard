If the length of the array is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers. If the length of the array is odd, it simply returns the middle number.\n\nIn the example usage, we calculate the median of an array `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`. The output will be `median = 5.0`, since 5 is the middle number in this array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":10.435108452,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-24391,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
