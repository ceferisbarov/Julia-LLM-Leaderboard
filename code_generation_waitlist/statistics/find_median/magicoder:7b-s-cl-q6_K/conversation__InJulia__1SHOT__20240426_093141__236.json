Suppose that we have an array of integers:\n```julia\narr = [10, 23, 56, 78, 42]\nmedian_value = find(arr)\nprintln(\"Median value is $median_value\")\n```\nThis will print: \"Median value is 34.0\", which is the median of our array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,182],"elapsed":37.005196739,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-24395,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
