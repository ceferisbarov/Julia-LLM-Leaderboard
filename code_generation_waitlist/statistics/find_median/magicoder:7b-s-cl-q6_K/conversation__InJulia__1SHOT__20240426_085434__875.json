The exact implementation will depend on what you want to do. You might need to pass your input array as a function argument or read it from a file.","status":200,"tokens":[39,171],"elapsed":36.178720546,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-4488,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
