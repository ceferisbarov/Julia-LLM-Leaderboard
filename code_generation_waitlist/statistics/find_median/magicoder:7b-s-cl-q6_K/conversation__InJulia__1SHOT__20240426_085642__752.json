However, since we want to create our own custom function, let's do it as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction find(arr)\n    sort_arr = sort(arr) # Sort array in ascending order\n    len = length(sort_arr)\n    if isodd(len) \n        return sort_arr[len÷2+1] # If list has odd number of elements, median is the middle value\n    else \n        return (sort_arr[len÷2]+sort_arr[len÷2+1])/2 # If list has even number of elements, median is average of middle two values\n    end\nend\n```\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\narr = [34, 56, 10, 89, 23]\nprintln(find(arr)) # Output: 34\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":40.274665672,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":5408,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
