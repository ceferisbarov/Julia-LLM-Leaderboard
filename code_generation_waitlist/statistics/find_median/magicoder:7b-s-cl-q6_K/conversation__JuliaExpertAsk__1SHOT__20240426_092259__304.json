If it's odd we directly find the median by returning the middle element, while for even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nLet's test this function with an example:\n```julia\narr = [1,2,3,4,5]\nprintln(find(arr)) # prints 3.0\n```\nHere we have an array `[1,2,3,4,5]` and the median is `3` as it's the middle number in this sorted array.","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":49.206866856,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":5923,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
