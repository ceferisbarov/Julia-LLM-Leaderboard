(arr[n÷2] + arr[n÷2+1])/2 : arr[div(n+1, 2)]\nend\n```\nIn this function, I first sort the given array. Then, if its length is even, I take the average of two middle elements; otherwise, I return the single middle element. Here's an example:\n\n```julia\narr = [1, 3, 5, 7]\nprintln(find_median(arr)) # Output: 3.5\n```","status":200,"tokens":[78,179],"elapsed":42.578978151,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-362,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
