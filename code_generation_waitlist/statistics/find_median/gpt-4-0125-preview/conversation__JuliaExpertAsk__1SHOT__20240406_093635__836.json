The function first sorts the array and then calculates the median based on whether the length of the array is odd or even.\n\n```julia\nfunction find_median(arr::AbstractArray)\n    sorted_arr = sort(arr)\n    len = length(arr)\n    \n    if isodd(len)\n        return sorted_arr[ceil(Int, len / 2)]\n    else\n        return 0.5 * (sorted_arr[len รท 2] + sorted_arr[len รท 2 + 1])\n    end\nend\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```julia\n# Example for an odd length array\narr_odd = [7, 1, 3, 9, 5]\nprintln(find_median(arr_odd))  # Output: 5\n\n# Example for an even length array\narr_even = [7, 1, 3, 9]\nprintln(find_median(arr_even)) # Output: 5.0\n```\n\nIn these examples, the function sorts the input arrays and finds their medians. For the odd-length array `[7, 1, 3, 9, 5]`, the median is `5`, and for the even-length array `[7, 1, 3, 9]`, the median is calculated as the average of `3` and `7`, which is `5.0`.","status":200,"tokens":[71,296],"elapsed":9.021704542,"cost":0.009590000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1505656220,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
