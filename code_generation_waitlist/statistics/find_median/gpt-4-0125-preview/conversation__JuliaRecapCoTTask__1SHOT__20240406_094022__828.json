[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `find`. It computes median over arbitrary array.

Then, it checks if the number of elements is even or odd and calculates the median accordingly.\n\n## Example\n\nNow, let's provide an example usage of the `find_median` function:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\narr1 = [5, 3, 8, 1, 9, 10]\nmedian1 = find_median(arr1)\nprintln(\"The median of arr1 is: \", median1)\n\narr2 = [4, 2, 5, 9]\nmedian2 = find_median(arr2)\nprintln(\"The median of arr2 is: \", median2)\n```\n\n## Double-check the solution correctness\n\nFor the array `[5, 3, 8, 1, 9, 10]`, sorted is `[1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10]` so the median is `(5 + 8) / 2 = 6.5`.\n\nFor the array `[4, 2, 5, 9]`, sorted is `[2, 4, 5, 9]`, so the median is `(4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5`.\n\nThese checks ensure that the solution logic is implemented correctly according to the definition of the median for both even and odd number of elements in an array.","status":200,"tokens":[296,534],"elapsed":17.330853917,"cost":0.01898,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-389228609,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
