If the length of the array is odd, the median is the middle element. If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**: I will write the function `find_median` that implements this logic.\n3. **Solve the task**: Write the code for `find_median`.\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**: I will test the function with a couple of example arrays to ensure correctness.\n\n### Writing the function\n\n```julia\nfunction find_median(arr)\n    # Step 1: Sort the array\n    sort!(arr)\n    \n    # Step 2: Check length of the array\n    n = length(arr)\n    \n    # Step 3: Determine the median based on odd or even length\n    if n % 2 == 0\n        # Even length, average of two middle elements\n        return (arr[n รท 2] + arr[n รท 2 + 1]) / 2\n    else\n        # Odd length, middle element\n        return arr[ceil(Int, n / 2)]\n    end\nend\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```julia\n# Example 1: Odd number of elements\nprintln(find_median([1, 3, 5, 2, 4]))\n\n# Example 2: Even number of elements\nprintln(find_median([10, 5, 6, 2, 11, 17]))\n```\n\nIn the first example, the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and the median is 3, because it is the middle element. In the second example, the sorted array is `[2, 5, 6, 10, 11, 17]`, and the median is (6+10)/2 = 8, which is the average of the two middle elements.","status":200,"tokens":[133,431],"elapsed":11.564926541,"cost":0.01426,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1270836924,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
