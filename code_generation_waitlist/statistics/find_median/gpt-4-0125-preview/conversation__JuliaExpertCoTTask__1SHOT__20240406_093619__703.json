It computes the median for any given array.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct:**\n\n- **Example 1:**\n   ```julia\n   find_median([1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9])\n   ```\n   For this sorted array `[1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, the median is `6`, which is the middle element.\n\n- **Example 2:**\n   ```julia\n   find_median([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9])\n   ```\n   For this sorted array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]`, the median is `(4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5`, which is the average of the two middle elements.\n\nLet's execute these examples to confirm the solution works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[133,412],"elapsed":10.715659542,"cost":0.013689999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":615675517,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
