Below is the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction find_median(arr::Array{T,1}) where T\n    sorted_arr = sort(arr)\n    n = length(sorted_arr)\n    if n % 2 == 0\n        return (sorted_arr[n รท 2] + sorted_arr[n รท 2 + 1]) / 2\n    else\n        return sorted_arr[ceil(Int, n / 2)]\n    end\nend\n\n# Example\nprintln(find_median([7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6]))  # for odd length, expect 4\nprintln(find_median([8, 2, 7, 3, 5, 6, 4, 1]))  # for even length, expect 4.5\n```\n\nThis function is generic and can handle arrays of any numeric type that supports sorting and arithmetic operations. The example shows how to compute the median for both an array of odd and even length.","status":200,"tokens":[71,252],"elapsed":10.760193375,"cost":0.00827,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-142297045,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
