The function `find_median` takes an array `arr` as input.\n2. It calculates the length of the array `n` using the `length` function.\n3. The array is sorted in ascending order using the `sort` function, and the result is stored in `sorted_arr`.\n4. If the number of elements in the array is even (`n % 2 == 0`):\n   - The middle index `mid` is calculated as `n รท 2` (integer division).\n   - The median is computed as the average of the two middle elements: `(sorted_arr[mid] + sorted_arr[mid+1]) / 2`.\n5. If the number of elements in the array is odd:\n   - The middle index `mid` is calculated as `(n + 1) รท 2` (integer division).\n   - The median is directly taken as the middle element: `sorted_arr[mid]`.\n6. Finally, the function returns the computed median value.\n\nIn the example usage:\n- An array `arr` is defined with the values `[5, 2, 9, 1, 7, 4, 8, 3, 6]`.\n- The `find_median` function is called with `arr` as the argument, and the result is stored in `median_value`.\n- The computed median value is printed.\n\nOutput:\n```\nMedian of the array: 5.0\n```\n\nThe function `find_median` correctly computes the median of the given array, which is `5.0` in this example.","status":200,"tokens":[139,609],"elapsed":21.270961584,"cost":0.04776,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":25075,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
