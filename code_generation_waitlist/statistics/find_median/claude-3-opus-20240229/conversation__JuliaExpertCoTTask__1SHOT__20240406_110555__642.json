Sort the input array in ascending order\n2. Check the length of the sorted array\n   - If odd, return the middle element\n   - If even, return the average of the two middle elements\n\nHere's the implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction find_median(arr)\n    sorted_arr = sort(arr)\n    len = length(sorted_arr)\n    mid = len รท 2\n\n    if isodd(len)\n        return sorted_arr[mid + 1]\n    else\n        return (sorted_arr[mid] + sorted_arr[mid + 1]) / 2\n    end\nend\n```\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\narr1 = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3]\nprintln(find_median(arr1))  # Output: 4.0\n\narr2 = [4, 7, 2, 9, 3, 1, 6]\nprintln(find_median(arr2))  # Output: 4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- For `arr1`, the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]`. The length is 6 (even), so the median is the average of the two middle elements `(3 + 5) / 2 = 4.0`.\n- For `arr2`, the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9]`. The length is 7 (odd), so the median is the middle element `4`.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(n) to store the sorted array.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions!","status":200,"tokens":[139,424],"elapsed":15.052513875,"cost":0.033885,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-10078,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
