Iterate through the array and count the occurrences of each element using a dictionary.\n2. Find the maximum occurrence value.\n3. Collect all elements that have occurrences equal to the maximum value found in step 2 to support multimodal arrays.\n4. Return the collected elements as the mode.\n\n## Write any functions and other code you need\n\nLet's start by implementing the `find_mode` function as described:\n\n```julia\nfunction find_mode(arr)\n    counts = Dict()\n    for element in arr\n        counts[element] = get(counts, element, 0) + 1\n    end\n\n    max_count = maximum(values(counts))\n    mode_elements = [key for (key, value) in counts if value == max_count]\n\n    return mode_elements\nend\n```\n\n## Solve the task\n\nWe have implemented the `find_mode` function based on the approach.\n\n## Check that your solution is correct\n\nLet's provide an example to test the function:\n\n```julia\n# Test example\narr = [2, 3, 4, 3, 5, 3, 6, 7, 7, 7]\nprintln(find_mode(arr))\n```\n\nThe `arr` array has the number `3` and `7` appearing the most times (three times each), so it's expected that the output will show both as the mode(s).","status":200,"tokens":[134,308],"elapsed":8.830553375,"cost":0.010579999999999999,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-120980999,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
