The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. In case of multiple values having the same highest frequency, all such values are modes.\n\n2. **Plan the Solution**: \n    - To find the mode, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each element.\n    - Iterate through the array, update the frequency count for each element.\n    - Find the maximum frequency present.\n    - Iterate through the frequency dictionary to find all elements with frequency equal to the maximum frequency found.\n    - Return these elements as they collectively represent the mode.\n\n3. **Write Code**\n\n4. **Test Solution** with an example.\n\n### Step 3: Write Functions and Other Code\n\n```julia\nfunction find_mode(arr)\n    # Step 1: Create a dictionary to store frequency of elements\n    freq_dict = Dict()\n    for el in arr\n        freq_dict[el] = get(freq_dict, el, 0) + 1\n    end\n\n    # Step 2: Find the maximum frequency\n    max_freq = maximum(values(freq_dict))\n\n    # Step 3: Find all elements with frequency equal to max frequency\n    mode_elements = [key for (key, value) in freq_dict if value == max_freq]\n\n    return mode_elements\nend\n```\n\n### Step 4: Test Solution\n\nProviding an example to test the function:\n\n```julia\nexample_array = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]\nprintln(find_mode(example_array))\n```\n\nSince `3` appears most frequently in the provided `example_array`, the expected output is `[3]`. \n\nLet's proceed with implementing and testing this solution.","status":200,"tokens":[134,377],"elapsed":9.823487709,"cost":0.012650000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-138711567,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
