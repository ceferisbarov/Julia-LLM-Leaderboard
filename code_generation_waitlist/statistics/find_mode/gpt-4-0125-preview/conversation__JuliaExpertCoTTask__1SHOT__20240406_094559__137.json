The function `find_mode` will take an array `arr` as input.\n2. It will iterate through the array to count the occurrence of each element.\n3. It will determine the elements with the highest frequency.\n4. Since there can be multiple modes, the function will return all modes if more than one exists.\n5. Return the mode(s).\n\nLet's write the code:\n\n```julia\nfunction find_mode(arr)\n    counts = Dict{Any,Int}()\n    for element in arr\n        counts[element] = get(counts, element, 0) + 1\n    end\n    max_count = maximum(values(counts))\n    modes = [key for (key, value) in counts if value == max_count]\n    return modes\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's test the function with an example:\n\n```julia\n# Example\narr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5]\nprintln(find_mode(arr))\n```\n\nThis example has `3` as the mode since it appears most frequently (three times). The expected output should be `[3]`.","status":200,"tokens":[134,288],"elapsed":8.702864,"cost":0.00998,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2042490336,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
