To find the mode, I need to keep track of the frequency of each element in the array, then find the element(s) with the highest frequency.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code needed:** I will write the `find_mode` function that takes an array `arr` as input and returns the mode. The function will handle the case of multiple modes equally well.\n\n3. **Solve the task:**\n\n```julia\nfunction find_mode(arr)\n    # Create a dictionary to keep track of each number's frequency\n    frequency_dict = Dict()\n    \n    for num in arr\n        frequency_dict[num] = get(frequency_dict, num, 0) + 1\n    end\n    \n    # Find the maximum frequency\n    max_frequency = maximum(values(frequency_dict))\n    \n    # Filter the keys that match our maximum frequency\n    modes = [k for (k, v) in frequency_dict if v == max_frequency]\n    \n    # If there's only one mode, return it directly. Otherwise, return the list of modes\n    if length(modes) == 1\n        return modes[1]\n    else\n        return modes\n    end\nend\n```\n\n4. **Check that the solution is correct:**\nI will now write an example to verify that the function works correctly.\n\n```julia\n# Example 1\narr1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]\nprintln(find_mode(arr1)) # Should print 2\n\n# Example 2: Multiple modes\narr2 = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]\nprintln(find_mode(arr2)) # Should print [1, 3]\n```\n\nThese examples cover the case of a single mode and multiple modes.","status":200,"tokens":[134,403],"elapsed":13.850178209,"cost":0.013430000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2010534430,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
