In case of a tie, all such elements are considered the mode. Here's a basic implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction find_mode(arr)\n    counts = Dict{T, Int}() where T = typeof(arr[1])\n    max_count = 0\n    modes = []\n\n    for element in arr\n        counts[element] = get(counts, element, 0) + 1\n        max_count = max(max_count, counts[element])\n    end\n\n    for (element, count) in counts\n        if count == max_count\n            push!(modes, element)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return modes\nend\n\n# Example usage\narr_example = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4]\nprintln(find_mode(arr_example))\n```\n\nThis function will properly find and return the mode (or modes, in case of a tie) of the array. For the given `arr_example`, it'll output:\n\n```\n[4]\n```\n\nSince `4` appears most frequently in the array.","status":200,"tokens":[72,259],"elapsed":7.683872,"cost":0.00849,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1665941145,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
