Count the frequency of each unique element in the input array.\n2. Find the maximum frequency among the elements.\n3. Return all elements having the maximum frequency.\n\n```julia\nfunction find_mode(arr)\n    # Count the frequency of each element\n    freq = Dict{eltype(arr), Int}()\n    for x in arr\n        freq[x] = get(freq, x, 0) + 1\n    end\n    \n    # Find the maximum frequency\n    max_freq = maximum(values(freq))\n    \n    # Return elements with the maximum frequency\n    return [k for (k, v) in freq if v == max_freq]\nend\n```\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\narr1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]\nprintln(find_mode(arr1))  # Output: [4]\n\narr2 = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]\nprintln(find_mode(arr2))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n\narr3 = [1.5, 2.7, 3.2, 2.7, 1.5, 2.7]\nprintln(find_mode(arr3))  # Output: [2.7]\n```\n\nThe `find_mode` function works as follows:\n\n1. We use a dictionary `freq` to count the frequency of each unique element in the input array `arr`. The dictionary keys are the elements, and the values are their frequencies.\n\n2. We find the maximum frequency among the elements using the `maximum` function on the values of the `freq` dictionary.\n\n3. Finally, we return an array containing all elements from `freq` whose frequency is equal to the maximum frequency.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates the function with three different arrays:\n\n- In `arr1`, the mode is `4` as it appears the most frequently.\n- In `arr2`, all elements appear with equal frequency, so the function returns all elements as the mode.\n- In `arr3`, the mode is `2.7` as it appears the most frequently.\n\nThe function handles arrays with any element type, as long as the elements are hashable and comparable.","status":200,"tokens":[141,537],"elapsed":22.765394333,"cost":0.04239,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-4596,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
