Count the frequency of each unique element in the array\n2. Find the maximum frequency count\n3. Return the element(s) with the maximum frequency count\n\n```julia\nfunction find_mode(arr)\n    # Count frequency of each element\n    freq = Dict{eltype(arr),Int}()\n    for x in arr\n        freq[x] = get(freq, x, 0) + 1\n    end\n    \n    # Find max frequency\n    maxfreq = maximum(values(freq))\n    \n    # Return elements with max frequency\n    return [k for (k, v) in freq if v == maxfreq]\nend\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```julia\narr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]\nmode = find_mode(arr)\nprintln(mode)  # Output: [3]\n```\n\nIn this example, the element 3 appears most frequently (3 times), so the mode is [3].\n\nLet's test it with another example:\n\n```julia\narr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]\nmode = find_mode(arr) \nprintln(mode)  # Output: [1, 2]\n```\n\nHere, both 1 and 2 appear twice which is the maximum frequency, so the mode is [1, 2].\n\nThe solution works correctly for the given examples. The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input array.","status":200,"tokens":[141,359],"elapsed":15.570336792,"cost":0.029039999999999996,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-17475,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
