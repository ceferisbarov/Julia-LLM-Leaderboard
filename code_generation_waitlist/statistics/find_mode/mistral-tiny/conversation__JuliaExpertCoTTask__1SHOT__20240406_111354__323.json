Think through the approach:\n   The mode is the value that appears most frequently in an array.\n\n2. Write the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction find_mode(arr)\n    frequencies = Dict()\n    for num in arr\n        if haskey(frequencies, num)\n            frequencies[num] += 1\n        else\n            frequencies[num] = 1\n        end\n    end\n\n    mode = nothing\n    max_frequency = 0\n\n    for (num, freq) in frequencies\n        if freq > max_frequency\n            max_frequency = freq\n            mode = num\n        end\n    end\n\n    return mode\nend\n```\n\n3.
