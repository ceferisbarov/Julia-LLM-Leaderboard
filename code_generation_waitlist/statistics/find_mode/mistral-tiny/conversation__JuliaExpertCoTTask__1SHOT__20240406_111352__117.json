Think through the approach step by step:\n   - Find the frequency of each element in the array.\n   - Identify the element with the highest frequency, which is the mode.\n\n2. Write the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction find_mode(arr)\n    frequencies = Dict()\n    for num in arr\n        if haskey(frequencies, num)\n            frequencies[num] += 1\n        else\n            frequencies[num] = 1\n        end\n    end\n\n    mode = nothing\n    max_frequency = 0\n\n    for (number, frequency) in frequencies\n        if frequency > max_frequency\n            max_frequency = frequency\n            mode = number\n        end\n    end\n\n    return mode\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\njulia> find_mode([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3])\n3\n```\n\n4.
