Think through the approach:\n   The mode is the value that appears most frequently in an array. Let's use a Dictionary to store the frequency of each value in the array and then find the value with the highest frequency.\n\n2. Write the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction find_mode(arr)\n    freq_dict = Dict()\n    for elem in arr\n        isnothing(freq_dict[elem]) ? (freq_dict[elem] = 1) : (freq_dict[elem] += 1)\n    end\n\n    most_freq = 0\n    mode = nothing\n\n    for (key, value) in freq_dict\n        if value > most_freq\n            most_freq = value\n            mode = key\n        end\n    end\n\n    mode\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\njulia> find_mode([1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3])\n2\n```\n\n4.
