If the array only has a single unique value, it returns that value as the mode.\n2. It uses `eachindex(arr)` and `collect(eachindex(arr) .=> x -> arr[x])` to get an array of indices and the corresponding values.\n3. It uses `eachcol` to reshape the resulting array into columns.\n4. It uses `count` to count the occurrences of each value in the columns.\n5. It filters the resulting array to keep only the elements with a count greater than the array length divided by 2 (rounded up).\n6. It returns the first index of a `true` value in the filtered array, which corresponds to the mode.","status":200,"tokens":[80,321],"elapsed":4.912644834,"cost":0.002086,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1502675578,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
