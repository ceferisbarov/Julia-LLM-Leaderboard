[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `find_mode`. It computes mode over arbitrary array.

Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction find_mode(arr::AbstractArray{<:Number})\n    unique_arr, counts = unique(arr), countmap(x -> x, arr)\n    mode = findmax(counts)[1]\n    return unique_arr[findfirst(x -> x == mode, unique_arr)]\nend\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]\nprintln(\"Array: \", arr)\nprintln(\"Mode: \", find_mode(arr))\n```\n\nThis function uses the `unique` and `countmap` functions from Julia's standard library to find the unique elements and their corresponding counts in the array. Then, it finds the mode (most frequent element) by finding the maximum count using the `findmax` function. Finally, it returns the unique element that corresponds to the mode.","status":200,"tokens":[346,257],"elapsed":2.879213708,"cost":0.002234,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1896008211,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
