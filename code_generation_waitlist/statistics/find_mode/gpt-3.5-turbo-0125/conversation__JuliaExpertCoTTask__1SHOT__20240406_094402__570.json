Define a function `find_mode(arr)` that takes an array `arr` as input.\n2. Create an empty dictionary `counts` to store the count of each element in the array.\n3. Iterate through the elements of the array and update the counts in the dictionary.\n4. Find the maximum value in the dictionary which corresponds to the mode(s) of the array.\n5. Return the mode(s) as a list.\n\nExample:\n- `find_mode([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4])` \n    - The array `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]` has modes 3 (appears 3 times) and 2 (appears 2 times). \n    - So, the function will return `[3, 2]`.","status":200,"tokens":[134,183],"elapsed":2.286531042,"cost":0.0003415,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-117023040,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
