We create a dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each element in the input array `arr`.\n2. We iterate through the array and update the frequency of each element in the `freq` dictionary.\n3. We then iterate through the `freq` dictionary to find the element with the highest frequency, which is the mode.\n4. Finally, we return the mode.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array, as we need to iterate through the array once to count the frequencies, and then iterate through the dictionary once to find the mode.","status":200,"tokens":[141,412],"elapsed":4.312589834,"cost":0.0005502500000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":21953,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
