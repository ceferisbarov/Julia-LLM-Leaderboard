It first creates a dictionary `counts` that maps each unique element in the input array `arr` to its frequency (count) in the array.\n2. It then sorts the dictionary entries by the count (the second element of each tuple) in descending order, and takes the first (i.e., most frequent) element as the mode.\n\nThis implementation has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the length of the input array, due to the sorting step. It uses a dictionary to efficiently count the occurrences of each element, which makes it suitable for handling large or sparse arrays.","status":200,"tokens":[73,284],"elapsed":3.110835584,"cost":0.00037325,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":11835,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
