Here's a function `find_mode` that computes the mode of an arbitrary array:\n\n```julia\nfunction find_mode(arr)\n    counter = Dict()\n    for num in arr\n        counter[num] = get(counter, num, 0) + 1\n    end\n    mode = collect(keys(counter))[argmax(values(counter))]\n    return mode\nend\n```\n\nThis function first creates a dictionary `counter` to store the frequency of each number in the array `arr`. It then iterates through the input array, incrementing the count of each number in the dictionary. After counting the frequencies, the function finds the mode by getting the key corresponding to the maximum value in the dictionary.\n\nHere's an example of using the `find_mode` function:\n\n```julia\narr = [1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4, 5, 2]\nmode = find_mode(arr)\nprintln(\"The mode of the array is: \", mode)\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nThe mode of the array is: 2\n```\n\nIn this example, the mode of the array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4, 5, 2]` is `2`, since it appears the most times in the array.","status":200,"tokens":[75,329],"elapsed":3.556271041,"cost":0.002124,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1660873998,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
