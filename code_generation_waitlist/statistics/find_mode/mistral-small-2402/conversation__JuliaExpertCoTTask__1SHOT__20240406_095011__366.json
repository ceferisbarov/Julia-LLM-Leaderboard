It then iterates through the dictionary and keeps track of the maximum frequency and the corresponding mode(s). Finally, it returns the mode(s) as an array.\n\nTo check that the solution is correct, you can compare the output of the function to the expected result for a variety of test cases. In this example, the expected result is `[3, 4]`, which is the output of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[150,377],"elapsed":4.317832417,"cost":0.002562,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-893673565,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
