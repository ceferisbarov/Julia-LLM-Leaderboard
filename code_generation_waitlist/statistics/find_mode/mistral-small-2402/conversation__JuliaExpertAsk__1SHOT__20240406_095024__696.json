However, you can create a custom function to calculate it. Here's a simple implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics: countmap\n\nfunction find_mode(arr)\n    m = Dict(countmap(arr))\n    mode = collect(keys(m))[findfirst(x -> m[x] == maximum(values(m)), collect(keys(m)))]\n    return mode\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first creating a dictionary of unique elements and their counts using `countmap`. Then it finds the key(s) that have the maximum count. Since `findfirst` returns the index of the first occurrence of the maximum value, this function will return only one mode even if there are multiple modes in the array.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```julia\njulia> arr = [1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5]\njulia> find_mode(arr)\n4\n```\n\nIn this example, the mode of the array is 4.","status":200,"tokens":[75,269],"elapsed":2.95353225,"cost":0.001764,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-876698069,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
