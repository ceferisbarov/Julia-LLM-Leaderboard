Here's a function called `find_mode` that takes an arbitrary array and returns the mode:\n\n```julia\nfunction find_mode(arr)\n    # Count the frequency of each value in the array\n    freq_dict = Dict(x => count(==(x), arr) for x in unique(arr))\n\n    # Find the maximum frequency and corresponding value\n    max_freq = maximum(values(freq_dict))\n    mode = [k for (k, v) in freq_dict if v == max_freq]\n\n    return mode\nend\n```\n\nHere's an example of using the `find_mode` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Random\n\n# Generate a random array\narr = rand(1:10, 100)\n\n# Compute and print the mode\nmode = find_mode(arr)\nprintln(\"Mode: \", mode)\n```\n\nThis example generates an array of 100 random integers between 1 and 10, computes the mode, and prints the result. The output will vary based on the randomly generated numbers.","status":200,"tokens":[34,274],"elapsed":3.0444035,"cost":0.001712,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-424784311,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
