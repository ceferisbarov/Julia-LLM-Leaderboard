[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder for the Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `find_mode`. It computes mode over arbitrary array.

It then finds the maximum frequency, filters out elements with frequency less than the maximum, and returns the remaining elements as the mode(s).\n\nThe `find_mode` function accepts an arbitrary array as input, as specified in the task. The type of the array elements is inferred by Julia using the `eltype` function.\n\nThe function is designed to handle multiple modes. In the example, the array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]` has two modes: `2` and `4`.","status":200,"tokens":[341,400],"elapsed":4.4845185,"cost":0.003082,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-2022194478,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
