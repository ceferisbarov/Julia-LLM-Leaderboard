The result is returned as a single value.\n\nIn this example, we define an array `A` with three elements, and a weight vector `w` with three elements that are not necessarily normalized to 1. We then call the function `find_mean` on these arrays, and it returns the weighted mean of `A` with weights `w`.\n\nNote that the weight vector must be of the same size as the array `A`, or else an error will be thrown. Also note that this function does not modify the input arrays `A` and `w`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,313],"elapsed":155.971048751,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":1756,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
