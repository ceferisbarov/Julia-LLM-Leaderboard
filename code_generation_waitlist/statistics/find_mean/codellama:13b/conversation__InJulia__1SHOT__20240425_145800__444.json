The function returns the weighted mean of `A` with weights `w`.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```\njulia> A = [1, 2, 3, 4]\njulia> w = [0.5, 0.3, 0.2, 0.5]\njulia> find_mean(A, w)\n2.6\n```\nIn this example, `A` is a vector of values to be averaged, and `w` is a vector of weights for those values. The function returns the weighted mean of `A` with weights `w`, which is 2.6.","status":200,"tokens":[0,241],"elapsed":119.304374277,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":21674,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
