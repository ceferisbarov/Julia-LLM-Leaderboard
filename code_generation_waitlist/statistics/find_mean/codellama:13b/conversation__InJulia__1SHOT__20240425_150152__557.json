It returns the weighted mean of `A` with weights given by `w`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nA = [1, 2, 3]\nw = [0.5, 0.2, 0.3]\nfind_mean(A, w) # returns 2.3\n```\nIn this example, the weighted mean of `A` with weights given by `w` is computed as `(1*0.5 + 2*0.2 + 3*0.3) / (0.5 + 0.2 + 0.3)` which equals `2.3`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":108.439343638,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":30155,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
