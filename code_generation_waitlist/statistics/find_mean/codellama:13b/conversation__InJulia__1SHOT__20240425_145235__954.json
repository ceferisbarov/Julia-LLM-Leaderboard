It returns the weighted mean of the values in `A`.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `find_mean` function:\n```julia\n# Example data\nA = [1, 2, 3]\nw = [0.5, 0.2, 0.3]\n\n# Compute the weighted mean of A with weights w\nresult = find_mean(A, w)\n\nprintln(\"Weighted mean: $result\")\n```\nThis code will output `Weighted mean: 1.875`.","status":200,"tokens":[52,242],"elapsed":138.304188439,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-25866,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
