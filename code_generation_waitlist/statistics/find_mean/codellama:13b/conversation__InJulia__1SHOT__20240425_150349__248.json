The function returns the weighted mean of the values in `A` using the weights in `w`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\n# Example data\nA = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]\nw = [0.5, 0.25, 0.25]\n\n# Calculate weighted mean\nmean_value = find_mean(A, w)\n\nprintln(\"Weighted mean: $mean_value\")\n```\nThis will output `Weighted mean: 1.75`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,234],"elapsed":115.878378702,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-10486,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
