Here is an example of a function `find_mean` in Julia that computes the weighted mean of an array `A` with weight vector `w`:\n\n```julia\nfunction find_mean(A, w)\n    sum_weighted_values = sum(A .* w)\n    sum_weights = sum(w)\n    return sum_weighted_values / sum_weights\nend\n```\n\nHere is an example of how you can use this function with an array `A` and a weight vector `w`:\n\n```julia\nA = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nw = [0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.4]\n\nresult = find_mean(A, w)\nprintln(result)  # This will print the weighted mean of the array A\n```\n\nYou can run this code in a Julia environment to see the output.
