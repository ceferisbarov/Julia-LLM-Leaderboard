Understand the approach:\n   Compute the weighted mean by summing the product of each element in the array and its corresponding weight, and then dividing the result by the sum of all weights.\n\n2. Write the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction find_mean(A::AbstractArray{T}, w::AbstractArray{T}) where T<:Number\n    @assert length(A) == length(w) \"Arrays must have the same length\"\n\n    sum_product = sum(A .* w)\n    sum_weights = sum(w)\n\n    return sum_product / sum_weights\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage:\nA = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]\nw = [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]\nmean_weighted = find_mean(A, w)\nprintln(\"Mean of array A with weights w: \", mean_weighted)\n```\n\n4. Check the solution:\n\nTo verify the solution, I'll manually calculate the weighted mean using the example data:\n\n```julia\nexpected_mean = 1.0 * 0.5 + 2.0 * 0.3 + 3.0 * 0.2\n@test mean_weighted â‰ˆ expected_mean\n```\n\nThe output should be:\n\n```\nMean of array A with weights w: 1.95\n```\n\n```\ntrue\n```","status":200,"tokens":[167,385],"elapsed":11.820596375,"cost":0.002644,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":1888050621,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
