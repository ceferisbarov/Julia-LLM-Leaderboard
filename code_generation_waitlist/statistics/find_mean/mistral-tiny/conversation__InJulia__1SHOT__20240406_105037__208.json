Then, it multiplies each element of `A` with the corresponding element of `w` and sums up the results using the dot `.` operator. The function also sums up the weights `w` and calculates the weighted mean by dividing the sum of the weighted elements by the sum of the weights.","status":200,"tokens":[49,274],"elapsed":5.998297292,"cost":0.001742,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":-1349171859,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
