The function checks if the length of both vectors is equal. If not, it raises an error. The function then computes the weighted sum of the elements in `A` multiplied by their corresponding weights in `w` and divides it by the sum of the weights to find the weighted mean. The example usage initializes `A` and `w` with the given values and prints the computed weighted mean.","status":200,"tokens":[90,249],"elapsed":9.562515167,"cost":0.0016740000000000001,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":673013342,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
