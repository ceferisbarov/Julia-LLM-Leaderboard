It then computes the weighted mean by element-wise multiplication of each entry in `A` with its corresponding weight in `w`, followed by summation, divided by the sum of weights to normalize the result.\n\nHere's an example:\n```julia\nA = [1, 2, 3]\nw = [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]\nfind_mean(A, w)  # Output: 2.1\n```\nIn this case, the weighted mean of array `A` with weights `[0.5, 0.3, 0.2]` is approximately 2.1 (since the sum of the elements in `w` is 0.8).","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":43.365808854,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":20146,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
