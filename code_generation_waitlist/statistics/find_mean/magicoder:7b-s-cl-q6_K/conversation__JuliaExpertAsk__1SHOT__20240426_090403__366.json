It's worth noting that this function assumes both `A` and `w` have the same length. \n\nHere is an example:\n```julia\nA = [1, 2, 3]\nw = [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]\nfind_mean(A, w)\n```\nThis will output `2.1` which is the weighted mean of array `A` with weights `w`. The function works by multiplying each element in `A` by its corresponding weight in `w`, then summing these products, and finally dividing by the total weight.","status":200,"tokens":[0,207],"elapsed":37.49164097,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-12913,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
