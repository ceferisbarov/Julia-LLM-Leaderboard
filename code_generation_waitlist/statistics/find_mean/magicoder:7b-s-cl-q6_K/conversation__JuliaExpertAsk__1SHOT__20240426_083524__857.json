The sum of products of each element from `A` multiplied by its corresponding weight is divided by the total sum of weights. We use `.*`, a matrix multiplication operator in Julia, for element-wise multiplication of arrays or vectors.","status":200,"tokens":[0,188],"elapsed":33.656126187,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-10990,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
