The sum of these products is divided by the sum of the weight vector `w` to get the weighted mean. Here's an example of how you could use this function:\n\n```julia\nA = [1., 2., 3.]\nw = [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]\nprintln(find_mean(A, w))  # Output: 2.1\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,200],"elapsed":41.573590831,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-29079,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
