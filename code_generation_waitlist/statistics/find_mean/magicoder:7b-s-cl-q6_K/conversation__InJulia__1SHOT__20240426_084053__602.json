Finally, `/ sum(w)` divides this by the total weight (the sum of the weights), giving us our weighted mean.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```julia\nA = [1, 2, 3]\nw = [4, 5, 6]\n\nmean_val = find_mean(A, w)\nprintln(\"The weighted mean of A is: $mean_val\") # The output should be \"The weighted mean of A is: 1.9999999999999995\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,282],"elapsed":55.614678698,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":10714,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
