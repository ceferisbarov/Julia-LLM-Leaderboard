The multiplication operation (`.*`) is element-wise in Julia, and it works with vectors or matrices as well. \n\nLet's test this function using a simple example:\n\n```julia\nA = [1, 2, 3]\nw = [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]\nmean_val = find_mean(A, w)\nprintln(\"The weighted mean is $mean_val\")\n```\nThis will output: `The weighted mean is 1.7`","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":47.250223871,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-7057,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
