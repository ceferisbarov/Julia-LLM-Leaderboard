This creates a new array with the weighted values. It then divides the sum of these weighted values by the sum of the weights to find the final mean.","status":200,"tokens":[0,163],"elapsed":32.335111061,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":11627,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
