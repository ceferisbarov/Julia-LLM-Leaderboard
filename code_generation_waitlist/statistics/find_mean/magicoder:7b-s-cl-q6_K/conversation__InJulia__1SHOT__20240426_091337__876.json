This function calculates the sum of products of elements from arrays `A` and `w`, then divides by the sum of `w`.\n\n```julia\nfunction find_mean(A::Vector, w::Vector)\n    @assert length(A) == length(w) \"Arrays A and w should have the same size.\"\n    return sum(a * b for (a, b) in zip(A, w)) / sum(w)\nend\n```\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\nA = [1, 2, 3]\nw = [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]\nprint(find_mean(A, w))\n```\nIn this example, the weighted mean of `A` with weights `w` would be calculated as `(1*0.5 + 2*0.3 + 3*0.2) / (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.2)`. The result will be printed to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":44.939743561,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-16492,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
