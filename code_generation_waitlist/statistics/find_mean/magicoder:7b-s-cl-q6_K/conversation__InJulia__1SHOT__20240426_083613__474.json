This is easily done using the built-in functions `sum` and `Base.broadcast!`. Here's how to do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction find_mean(A::Array, w::Vector) \n    return sum(@. A * w) / sum(w) \nend\n```\n\nYou can call this function with your data like this:\n\n```julia\n# Define the array and weights\nA = [1,2,3]  # Your values here\nw = [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]  # Weights for each value in A\n\nmean_val = find_mean(A, w)\nprintln(\"The weighted mean is: \", mean_val)\n```\n\nThis program will print the weighted mean of `A` with weights `w`.","status":200,"tokens":[51,221],"elapsed":48.349119673,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":10656,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
