For each pair (x, y), x is an element from array A and y is a corresponding weight from the vector w, then we compute the sum of these weighted values. The result is then divided by the sum of weights to get the mean value.\n\nFor the example given, the output will be \"Weighted mean: 2.1\"","status":200,"tokens":[91,246],"elapsed":61.404933757,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-3372,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
