Here is the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction find_mean(A::Array{Float64}, w::Vector{Float64})\n    if length(A) != length(w)\n        throw(\"Length of weights does not match with array\")\n    end\n    return sum(A.*w)/sum(w)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in two arguments: an array `A` and a vector `w`. It first checks if the lengths of `A` and `w` are equal, throwing an error if they're not. Then, it computes the weighted mean by element-wise multiplication of `A` with `w`, summing up the result, and dividing by the sum of `w`. \n\nHere is an example:\n```julia\nA = [10, 20, 30] # Array of numbers\nw = [0.5, 0.3, 0.2] # Weights for each number in array A\nfind_mean(A, w) # Returns the weighted mean of A with weights w\n```","status":200,"tokens":[51,246],"elapsed":53.06510224,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":339,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
