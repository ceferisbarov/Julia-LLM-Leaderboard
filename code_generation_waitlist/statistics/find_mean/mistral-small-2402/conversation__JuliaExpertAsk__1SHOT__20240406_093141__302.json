The function calculates the weighted mean by summing up the product of each data point and its corresponding weight, then dividing the result by the sum of all weights.","status":200,"tokens":[85,243],"elapsed":3.18800375,"cost":0.001628,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":606634609,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
