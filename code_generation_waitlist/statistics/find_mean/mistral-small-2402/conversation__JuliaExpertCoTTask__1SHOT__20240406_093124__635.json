When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `find_mean`. It computes the weighted mean of array `A` with weight vector `w`.

The weighted mean is `2.9`.\n\nThe function first checks that the array and weight vector have the same length using an assertion. It then calculates the sum of the products of the array elements and their corresponding weights, as well as the sum of the weights. The weighted mean is then returned as the sum of the products divided by the sum of the weights.","status":200,"tokens":[162,419],"elapsed":5.304877,"cost":0.0028380000000000002,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"stop","run_id":2086045797,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
