The `find_mean` function is then called with these inputs, and the weighted mean is computed. Finally, we print out the result.\n\nWhen you run this code, you should see an output like:\n```\nWeighted mean: 2.571428571428571\n```\nThis means that the weighted mean of the elements in `A` using the weights in `w` is approximately 2.57.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":12.465846062,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-29982,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
