The function first checks if `A` and `w` have the same length. Then it calculates the weighted sum by multiplying each element of `A` with its corresponding weight in `w`, and sums them up. Finally, it divides the weighted sum by the sum of weights to get the weighted mean.\n\nIn this example, we define an array `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and a weight vector `w = [0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.2]`. We then call the `find_mean` function with these inputs and print the result:\n```\nWeighted mean: 2.8\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,371],"elapsed":17.458046374,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-8300,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
