The function then divides this result by the sum of weights (`sum(w)`) to get the weighted mean.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\n# Define a sample array A and its corresponding weight vector w\nA = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nw = [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.1]\n\n# Calculate the weighted mean using find_mean function\nweighted_mean = find_mean(A, w)\nprintln(\"Weighted Mean: \", weighted_mean)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```julia\nWeighted Mean: 2.5\n```\n\nThis means that the weighted mean of the array `A` with weights `w` is approximately 2.5.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":11.430033906,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-23875,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
