The function calculates the weighted mean by multiplying each value in `A` with its corresponding weight in `w`, summing up these products, and then dividing by the sum of weights.","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":9.67428654,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":27506,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
