Finally, it divides this total by the sum of all weights to get the average.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```julia\nA = [1, 2, 3]\nw = [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]\n\nresult = find_mean(A, w)\nprintln(result) # Output: 1.75\n```\n\nIn this example, the weighted mean is calculated by multiplying each element in array `A` (which are 1, 2 and 3) with its corresponding weight from vector `w`. These products are then summed up (0.5 + 0.6 + 0.6 = 2.7). Finally, this total is divided by the sum of all weights (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.2 = 1.0) to get the average which is 2.7.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":11.438459093,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-1699,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
