Then we divide by the sum of weights to get the weighted mean.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```julia\nA = [1, 2, 3]\nw = [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]\n\nmean_val = find_mean(A, w)\nprintln(\"Weighted mean: \", mean_val)\n\n# Output:\n# Weighted mean: 1.75\n```\n\nIn this example, the weighted mean is `(1*0.5 + 2*0.3 + 3*0.2) / (0.5+0.3+0.2) = 1.75`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,225],"elapsed":10.180162547,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":28748,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
