The dot product of `A` and `w` gives the sum of products of each element in `A` with its corresponding weight in `w`, which is then divided by the sum of weights to get the weighted mean.","status":200,"tokens":[0,154],"elapsed":7.068988364,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-7760,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
