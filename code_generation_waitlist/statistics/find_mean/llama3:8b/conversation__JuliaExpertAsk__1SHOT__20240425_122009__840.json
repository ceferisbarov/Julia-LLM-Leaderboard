Here's an example:\n\n```julia\nA = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nw = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]\n\nresult = find_mean(A, w)\nprintln(\"The weighted mean is: $result\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the weighted mean of the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]` with weights `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]` would be calculated and printed out.","status":200,"tokens":[0,193],"elapsed":9.165642232,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":864,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
