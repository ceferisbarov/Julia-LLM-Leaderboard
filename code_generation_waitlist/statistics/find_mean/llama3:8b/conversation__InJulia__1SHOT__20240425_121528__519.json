It assumes that both arrays have the same length, and that array `w` contains weights corresponding to each element in array `A`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nA = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nw = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2]\n\nmean_val = find_mean(A, w)\nprintln(\"Weighted mean: \", mean_val)\n```\n\nIn this example, the weighted mean is computed by multiplying each element in `A` with its corresponding weight in `w`, summing these products, and then dividing by the sum of all weights.","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":13.539709452,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-31328,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
