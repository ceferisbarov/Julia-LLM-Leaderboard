The function returns the weighted mean of `A`.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```julia\nA = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nw = [0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0]\nprintln(\"Weighted Mean: \", find_mean(A, w))\n```\n\nIn this example, the weighted mean of `[1, 2, 3, 4]` with weights `[0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0]` is `(1*0.5 + 2*0.25 + 3*0.125) / (0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125)` which simplifies to `1.875`.","status":200,"tokens":[46,236],"elapsed":11.22331576,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":30241,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
