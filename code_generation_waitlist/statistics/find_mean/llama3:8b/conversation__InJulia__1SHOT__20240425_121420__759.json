The function first checks if both arrays have the same size. Then it iterates over the elements of the arrays, calculating the sum of the products of corresponding elements from `A` and `w`, and finally returns this sum divided by the sum of all the weights.\n\nIn this example, the weighted mean would be calculated as follows: `(1*0.1 + 2*0.2 + 3*0.3 + 4*0.2 + 5*0.2) / (0.1 + 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.2)` which would give approximately `3`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":14.803259208,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":-16265,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
