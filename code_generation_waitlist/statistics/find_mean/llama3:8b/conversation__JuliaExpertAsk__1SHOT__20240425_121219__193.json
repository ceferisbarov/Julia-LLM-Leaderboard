Suppose we have a 3x2 matrix A and a weight vector w of length 2.\n\n```julia\nA = [1 2; 3 4; 5 6]\nw = [0.5, 0.5]\n\nmean_value = find_mean(A, w)\nprintln(\"The weighted mean is: \", mean_value)\n```\n\nWhen we run this code, it will calculate the weighted mean of A with weights from w and print the result.\n\nPlease note that `dot` function in Julia calculates the dot product (i.e., sum of products) of two vectors. The `sum` function calculates the sum of elements in a vector.","status":200,"tokens":[86,185],"elapsed":13.094000411,"cost":0.0,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":null,"run_id":27923,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
