Check that the input arrays have the same length. If not, raise an error.\n2. Compute the weighted sum by multiplying each element in `A` with its corresponding weight in `w`, and then summing the results.\n3. Compute the weighted mean by dividing the weighted sum by the sum of the weights.\n4. Return the weighted mean.\n\nThe expected output for the example data is:\n\n```\nThe weighted mean is: 5.6666666666666665\n```","status":200,"tokens":[152,389],"elapsed":3.664444292,"cost":0.00052425,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-24802,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
