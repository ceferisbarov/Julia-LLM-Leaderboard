The function takes two arrays `A` and `w` as inputs, where `w` represents the weights.\n2. It first checks that the arrays have the same length using the `@assert` macro.\n3. The weighted mean is computed as the sum of element-wise multiplication of `A` and `w`, divided by the sum of the weights.","status":200,"tokens":[82,264],"elapsed":2.65749825,"cost":0.00035050000000000006,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":-4581,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
