Elementwise multiplication of the array `A` and the weight vector `w` using the `.*` operator.\n2. Summing the weighted values using `sum(A .* w)`.\n3. Dividing the sum of weighted values by the sum of weights `sum(w)` to get the final weighted mean.\n\nThis compact implementation leverages Julia's efficient array operations and broadcasting to provide a concise and performant solution.","status":200,"tokens":[82,261],"elapsed":2.663465834,"cost":0.00034675000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":4311,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
