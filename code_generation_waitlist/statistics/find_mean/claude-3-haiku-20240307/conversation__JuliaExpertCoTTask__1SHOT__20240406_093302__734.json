The `find_mean` function takes two input arguments: `A`, the array of values, and `w`, the vector of weights.\n2. The function calculates the weighted sum by element-wise multiplying `A` and `w`, and then summing the result.\n3. The function then calculates the total sum of the weights.\n4. Finally, the function returns the weighted mean by dividing the weighted sum by the total sum of the weights.\n5. The example demonstrates the usage of the `find_mean` function with a sample array `A` and weight vector `w`.\n\nThe output of the example is `3.5`, which is the weighted mean of the array `A` with the given weights `w`.","status":200,"tokens":[152,370],"elapsed":4.309568208,"cost":0.0005005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":17068,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
