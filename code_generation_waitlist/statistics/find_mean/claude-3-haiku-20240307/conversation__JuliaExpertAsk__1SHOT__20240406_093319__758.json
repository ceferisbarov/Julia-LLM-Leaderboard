The function `find_mean` takes two arguments: the array `A` and the weight vector `w`.\n2. It computes the element-wise product of `A` and `w` using the dot broadcasting operator `.*`, then sums the result and divides it by the sum of the weights `w`.\n3. The example demonstrates the usage of the function with sample data.","status":200,"tokens":[82,244],"elapsed":2.745484,"cost":0.00032550000000000005,"log_prob":null,"finish_reason":"end_turn","run_id":26356,"sample_id":null,"_type":"aimessage"}]
